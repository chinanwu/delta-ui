# Delta-UI

## Upcoming features:
- Versus mode!
- MORE accessibility!
- Scoring
- Mock API
- Get solutions to problems

## Want to view this UI?
Simply:
- `git clone` this repo!
- Open with your favourite IDE
- Run `npm i`, this will install all the dependencies!
- Then run `npm start`, this will start Delta-UI in a browser window

Note: As there is no mock API right now, this won't run without the Delta-API. The Delta-API is currently not finished so I haven't released it.

### Potential (Quality of Life/General) Improvements
- Rule refresher under the game
- Dark mode modal?
- Get a hint - Just be giving solver the current word as from, and provide next word in solution (that it comes up with)
    - Maybe lim. # of hints, and then after that the game gives you the option to give up?

### Code Cleanup Backlog
- Style files needs a cleanup

Some tools I used for this project:
- https://mycolor.space/gradient : For the making of the toggle tool's beautiful night sky gradients
