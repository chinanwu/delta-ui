# Delta-UI

## Upcoming features:
- Versus mode!
- MORE accessibility!
- Scoring
- Mock API

## Want to view this UI?
Simply:
- `git clone` this repo!
- Open with your favourite IDE
- Run `npm i`, this will install all the dependencies!
- Then run `npm start`, this will start Delta-UI in a browser window

Note: As there is no mock API right now, this won't run without the Delta-API. The Delta-API is currently not finished so I haven't released it.

## Potential Quality of Life Improvements
- Rule refresher under the game

## Code Cleanup Backlog
