# Delta-UI

## Upcoming features:
- Versus mode!
- MORE accessibility!
- Scoring
- Mock API
- Dictionary for words seen during game at the end of game
- Daily challenge - Perhaps pairings that require 10+ steps ?
- Wildcard ability - Turns one of the letters into a "blank" card basically. Allows you to essentially change 2 letters
    - e.g. bank -> book. Use wildcard ability on the "a", so it becomes b*nk -> book, where * can = o. Then we can go straight from bank -> book.

## Want to view this UI?
Simply:
- `git clone` this repo!
- Open with your favourite IDE
- Run `npm i`, this will install all the dependencies!
- Then run `npm start`, this will start Delta-UI in a browser window

Note: As there is no mock API right now, this won't run without the Delta-API. The Delta-API is currently not finished so I haven't released it.

### Potential (Quality of Life/General) Improvements
- Rule refresher under the game
- Dark mode modal?
- Meta description

### Code Cleanup Backlog
- Style files needs a cleanup
- Lazy loading? https://blog.logrocket.com/lazy-loading-components-in-react-16-6-6cea535c0b52/
